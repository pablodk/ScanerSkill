## Quick Start

Install ClawScan:

```bash
npm install -g @openclaw/clawscan
```

Command-backed scanners and judges run in ClawScan's Docker runtime by default,
so keep Docker running for local scans.

Run NVIDIA SkillSpector and Cisco Skill Scanner against a local `skills/` folder:

```bash
clawscan --scanner skillspector --scanner cisco
```

## Scan a known malicious skill

This example scans Trail of Bits' [`csv-summarizer`](https://github.com/trailofbits/overtly-malicious-skills/tree/4ffbf9461ef0505f9ce76a0d3694a18ec33ea531/skills/csv-summarizer) skill, which claims to summarize a CSV file but also prints every environment variable when run.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/overtly-malicious-skills.git /tmp/overtly-malicious-skills
cd /tmp/overtly-malicious-skills
git checkout 4ffbf9461ef0505f9ce76a0d3694a18ec33ea531
clawscan skills/csv-summarizer \
  --scanner skillspector \
  --scanner cisco \
  --output /tmp/clawscan-csv-summarizer.json
```

Sample findings:

```txt
targets: 1
scanner_completed: 2
scanner_failed: 0
scanner_skipped: 0
issues_found: 2
gate: pass
errors: 0
full_results: /tmp/clawscan-csv-summarizer.json
```

The results bundle keeps the top-level artifact plus per-scanner JSON reports.

## Motivation

Agent-skill security is new and fast-moving, with researchers and companies
exploring many promising scanners, datasets, and judge harnesses. In our
[ClawHub Security Signals paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2606.01494v1), we found
that combining multiple scanners with a configurable judge works better than
relying on any single scanner.

ClawScan turns that approach into a repeatable CLI. It includes a built-in `clawhub` profile, a saved scanner-and-judge configuration that matches what ClawHub runs in production, so researchers can reproduce results, test improvements, and help improve detection against the weekly refreshed ClawHub security-signals dataset.

## Commands

| Command family | Use |
| --- | --- |
| `clawscan <target> --scanner <id>` | Run one or more scanners against an explicit skill or OpenClaw plugin target. Omit `<target>` to scan child skill directories under `./skills`; plugins are never auto-discovered. |
| `clawscan scanners [list\|<scanner-id>]` | Discover supported scanner IDs, required env vars, upstream links, descriptions, and install guidance. |
| `clawscan profiles [-v]` | Inspect built-in profiles; `-v` prints the catalog as YAML. |
| `clawscan benchmark [list\|<benchmark-id>]` | Discover or run supported benchmarks through a selected scanner/profile/judge setup. |
| `clawscan install <scanner-id> [...]` | Install or verify local scanner dependencies where ClawScan has registry-backed install plans. |
| `clawscan openclaw-install-policy` | Act as an external OpenClaw `security.installPolicy.exec` command. Reads the staged install request from stdin and returns allow/warn/block JSON. |

## OpenClaw install policy

ClawScan integrates with OpenClaw at the operator-owned
`security.installPolicy` boundary. It does not register an install hook or
depend on plugin activation. The policy command scans the staged `sourcePath`
for both skills and plugins before OpenClaw commits a supported install or
update.

See [docs/openclaw-install-policy.md](docs/openclaw-install-policy.md) for the
trusted executable setup, configuration, payload contract, and scope.

## Scanners

`--scanner` selects a scanner adapter to run, writes its raw JSON evidence into
the results artifact, and can be repeated to compare multiple scanners in one
run:

```bash
clawscan ./my-skill \
  --scanner skillspector \
  --scanner cisco
```

Discover the scanner catalog from the CLI:

```bash
clawscan scanners
clawscan scanners skillspector
```

Functional axis only; complements the security scanners and does not detect malware or prompt injection.

Starting in `v0.1.2`, the built-in `aig` scanner uses Tencent's local
`aig-skill-scan` package instead of the legacy A.I.G Docker/API service.
Replace `AIG_MODEL` with `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `AIG_MODEL_BASE_URL` with
`DEFAULT_BASE_URL`, and `AIG_MODEL_API_KEY` with `LLM_API_KEY` (or
`OPENAI_API_KEY`). `AIG_BASE_URL` and `AIG_API_KEY` are no longer used.
The local scanner accepts directory targets only; materialize URL or file inputs
as a skill directory before scanning them with `aig`.

## Profiles

`--profile` runs a saved scanner and judge configuration, such as the built-in
`clawhub` profile that matches ClawHub's production scanner suite and Codex
judge harness:

```bash
clawscan ./my-skill --profile clawhub
```

The same profile accepts an explicit OpenClaw plugin directory (or its
`openclaw.plugin.json` manifest), runs the plugin-capable scanners in the
profile, and renders the bundled judge prompt with `packageRelease` target
context.

Inspect the built-in profile catalog:

```bash
clawscan profiles
clawscan profiles -v
```

### Available profiles

| Profile | Scanners | Judge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clawhub` | `skillspector`, `clawscan-static`, `aig` | Codex `gpt-5.5`, high reasoning, bundled ClawHub prompt/schema |
| `openclaw-install-policy` | `skillspector`, `clawscan-static` | none |

### Build a custom profile with `.clawscan.yml`

Custom profiles can be created in `.clawscan.yml`.

This is useful for version controlling iterations on your profile, creating multiple profiles to run over the same skills, etc

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/clawscan/main/schemas/clawscan.schema.json

version: 1
profiles:
  review:
    scanners:
      - skillspector
      - snyk
    sandbox:
      env:
        - OPENAI_API_KEY
        - CODEX_API_KEY
    judge:
      command: >
        codex exec --cd {{ workspace }}
        --model gpt-5.5
        --output-last-message {{ output }}
        - < {{ prompt:./prompt.md }}
```

The published schema provides editor completion and catches invalid profile
fields before a scan starts. ClawScan also validates every config at runtime.

## Judge Harness

`--judge` hands scanner evidence to an external agent command so it can inspect
the skill, do its own research in the scan workspace, and write a final JSON
verdict:

```bash
clawscan ./my-skill \
  --scanner skillspector \
  --judge 'codex exec --cd {{ workspace }} --output-last-message {{ output }} - < {{ prompt:./prompt.md }}'
```

Supported `--judge` placeholders:

| Placeholder | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `{{ workspace }}` | Temporary directory containing the copied skill, scanner JSON, and metadata. |
| `{{ judge_sandbox }}` | `danger-full-access` inside ClawScan's Docker sandbox, otherwise `read-only`. |
| `{{ prompt }}` | Render `./prompt.md` and pass the rendered prompt file path. |
| `{{ prompt:<path> }}` | Render a specific prompt template and pass that file path. |
| `{{ output_schema }}` | Copy `./schema.json` into the workspace and pass that file path. |
| `{{ output_schema:<path> }}` | Copy a specific schema file and pass that file path. |
| `{{ output }}` | File path where the judge should write its final JSON object. |

## Sandbox

ClawScan runs command-backed scanners and judges in
`ghcr.io/openclaw/clawscan-runtime:latest` by default:

```bash
clawscan ./my-skill --scanner skillspector
```

Use `--sandbox off` only in an already-isolated environment, or when you have
installed scanner dependencies on the host with `clawscan install`. Use
`--sandbox-env <NAME>` or a profile `sandbox.env` list to pass judge-specific
environment variables into the container.

## Benchmarks

`clawscan benchmark <benchmark-id>` runs a supported benchmark through the
selected scanners and optional judge harness:

```bash
clawscan benchmark list

clawscan benchmark SkillTrustBench \
  --profile clawhub \
  --output ./artifacts/skilltrustbench-clawhub.json
```

Use `--ids <path-or-url>` with SkillTrustBench to run a fixed subset from a
plain text ID list or JSONL rows with an `id` field.

### Available benchmarks

| Benchmark | ID | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ClawHub Security Signals | `clawhub-security-signals` | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OpenClaw/clawhub-security-signals) |
| SkillTrustBench | `SkillTrustBench` | [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cuhk-zhuque/SkillTrustBench) |

### Submitting a patch to the `clawhub` profile

If you are a security researcher who found malicious skills live on ClawHub and
want to improve the production scanner so it catches them, use GitHub private
vulnerability reporting for the sensitive details and open a PR containing only
a candidate `proposals/<GHSA-ID>/clawscan.yml` config. For a guided walkthrough,
ask Codex:

```text
Use $report-clawhub-malicious-skill to walk me through reporting a malicious ClawHub skill.
```

### ClawHub Profile Baseline

Maintainers validate accepted `clawhub` profile proposals against the public
SkillTrustBench leaderboard subset. The maintainer gate writes compact dated
baselines under `benchmarks/skilltrustbench-leaderboard-10pct/`; the latest
`YYYY-MM-DD.json` file is the current accepted baseline.
