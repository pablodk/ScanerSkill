# Profiles

`--profile` runs a saved scanner and judge configuration, such as the built-in
`clawhub` profile that matches ClawHub's production scanner suite and Codex
judge harness:

```bash
clawscan ./my-skill --profile clawhub
```

The same profile accepts an explicit OpenClaw plugin directory (or its
`openclaw.plugin.json` manifest), runs the plugin-capable scanners in the
profile, and renders the bundled judge prompt with `packageRelease` target
context.

## Config discovery

By default, ClawScan does not auto-discover `.clawscan.yml` or `.clawscan.yaml`
files from the current directory or parent directories.

ClawScan never loads a config file it was not explicitly pointed at. A
`.clawscan.yml` can define user-defined scanners whose commands execute with
your credentials in the environment, so silently loading one from the current
directory or a parent (for example, from inside a repository you are scanning)
would let an untrusted target execute commands. Pass `--config <path>` or opt in
with `--discover-config`.

To load a discovered config file, use one of these flags:

- `--config <path>` - Explicitly specify a config file path
- `--discover-config` - Search upward from the current directory and load the nearest `.clawscan.yml` or `.clawscan.yaml`

Mixing `--config` and `--discover-config` is an error. `--discover-config`
also requires `--profile`: without a profile the run would record the
discovered file as its config source while applying none of its settings.
Use `--config <path>` without `--profile` to run every profile in a config.

```bash
clawscan ./my-skill --config ./security/clawscan.yml --profile review
clawscan ./my-skill --profile review --discover-config
```

Without either flag, ClawScan uses built-in profiles and CLI flags only. The
`clawscan profiles` catalog command lists built-in profiles only.

## Inspect available profiles

Inspect the built-in profile catalog:

```bash
clawscan profiles
clawscan profiles -v
```

## Available profiles

| Profile | Scanners | Judge |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `clawhub` | `skillspector`, `clawscan-static`, `aig` | Codex `gpt-5.5`, high reasoning, bundled ClawHub prompt/schema |
| `openclaw-install-policy` | `skillspector`, `clawscan-static` | none |

## Build a custom profile with `.clawscan.yml`

Custom profiles can be created in `.clawscan.yml`.

This is useful for version controlling iterations on your profile, creating multiple profiles to run over the same skills, etc

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclaw/clawscan/main/schemas/clawscan.schema.json

version: 1
profiles:
  review:
    scanners:
      - skillspector
      - snyk
    sandbox:
      env:
        - OPENAI_API_KEY
        - CODEX_API_KEY
      mounts:
        - /opt/scanner-rules
        - path: /var/cache/clawscan
          write: true
    judge:
      command: >
        codex exec --cd {{ workspace }}
        --model gpt-5.5
        --output-last-message {{ output }}
        - < {{ prompt:./prompt.md }}
```

The schema gives editors completion and catches misspelled fields, invalid
types, unsupported values, and malformed gate rules before a scan starts.
ClawScan still validates the file when it loads so correctness does not depend
on editor support.

Sandbox mounts must use existing absolute host paths. A string mount is
read-only; set `write: true` only for a directory the scanner genuinely needs
to modify. The CLI equivalents are repeatable `--sandbox-mount /path` and
`--sandbox-mount /path:rw`.
