# OpenClaw install policy

ClawScan can run as OpenClaw's external `security.installPolicy.exec` command.
This is an operator-owned boundary. It does not require a ClawScan plugin,
plugin activation, or a new install hook.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Deploy this adapter only with an OpenClaw release whose protocol-v1 install

OpenClaw writes a protocol v1 request to the command's stdin before a supported
third-party skill or plugin install/update stage is committed. One install can
produce more than one policy call. ClawScan evaluates each staged
`sourcePath` and writes one protocol v1 allow/warn/block response to stdout.

## Resolve the trusted executable

Install the binary package:

```sh
npm install -g @openclaw/clawscan
```

OpenClaw requires the policy command to be an absolute, non-symlink path. The
package exports a resolver for its native executable:

```sh
node --input-type=module -e '
  import { pathToFileURL } from "node:url";
  const module = await import(pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href);
  console.log(module.resolveBundledBinaryPath());
' "$(npm root -g)/@openclaw/clawscan/lib/resolve-binary.mjs"
```

Use the printed path as `command`, and its containing directory in
`trustedDirs`.

## Configure OpenClaw

```json5
{
  security: {
    installPolicy: {
      enabled: true,
      targets: ["skill", "plugin"],
      exec: {
        source: "exec",
        command: "/absolute/path/to/clawscan",
        args: ["openclaw-install-policy"],
        trustedDirs: ["/absolute/path/to"],
        passEnv: ["PATH", "DOCKER_HOST"],
        timeoutMs: 1200000,
        noOutputTimeoutMs: 1200000,
        maxOutputBytes: 1048576,
      },
    },
  },
}
```

The default `openclaw-install-policy` profile composes SkillSpector and
`clawscan-static` deterministically and has no judge. ClawScan runs
command-backed scanners in Docker by default. `PATH` lets it locate Docker;
`DOCKER_HOST` is only needed when the local Docker setup uses it.

## Understand the sandbox boundary

There are two separate execution boundaries:

1. OpenClaw runs `security.installPolicy.exec` as a trusted local child of the
   Gateway/install process. The normal OpenClaw agent tool sandbox does not run
   or isolate this command.
2. ClawScan runs command-backed scanners such as SkillSpector in its own Docker
   sandbox. The built-in `clawscan-static` scanner runs inside the trusted
   ClawScan policy process.

OpenClaw downloads, clones, uploads, or extracts a candidate into a temporary
staging location before install commit. It sends the absolute staged
`sourcePath`, its `file` or `directory` kind, and the host-declared `skill` or
`plugin` target type to ClawScan over stdin. ClawScan uses that target type
directly instead of trying to rediscover it from a manifest.

For a command-backed scanner, ClawScan automatically bind-mounts every existing
absolute path passed to the scanner. The staged target is mounted read-only at
the same absolute path inside the container; the scanner's temporary result
directory is mounted writable. An invocation is conceptually equivalent to:

```sh
docker run --rm \
  --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/openclaw-install/package,target=/tmp/openclaw-install/package,readonly \
  --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/clawscan-results,target=/tmp/clawscan-results \
  ghcr.io/openclaw/clawscan-runtime:latest \
  skillspector scan /tmp/openclaw-install/package \
  --format json \
  --output /tmp/clawscan-results/report.json
```

Operators do not need to add a `--sandbox-mount` for `sourcePath`. That option
is only for extra operator-owned paths required by a custom scanner or judge.

### Containerized OpenClaw Gateway

When the OpenClaw Gateway itself runs in a container, the policy executable
must exist inside that container at the configured absolute `command` path.
The default nested scanner sandbox additionally requires the Docker CLI and
access to a Docker daemon.

If the Gateway container uses the host Docker socket, a staged path that exists
only in the Gateway container cannot be bind-mounted into the scanner
container. Docker resolves bind-mount sources in the daemon host's filesystem,
not the calling container's filesystem. The same rule applies to ClawScan's
writable temporary result directories.

Use one temporary root that is bind-mounted from the Docker host into the
Gateway at the same absolute path, set the Gateway's `TMPDIR` to that root, and
include `TMPDIR` in the policy command's `passEnv`. OpenClaw staging paths and
ClawScan result paths will then both be visible to the host Docker daemon:

```json5
passEnv: ["PATH", "DOCKER_HOST", "TMPDIR"]
```

For example, mount `/var/lib/openclaw-install-tmp` into the Gateway at
`/var/lib/openclaw-install-tmp` and start the Gateway with
`TMPDIR=/var/lib/openclaw-install-tmp`. Do not use a container-only `/tmp` for
either staging or ClawScan results in this nested-Docker topology.

Alternatively, treat the outer Gateway container as the isolation boundary,
install every selected command-backed scanner inside it, and explicitly disable
ClawScan's nested Docker sandbox:

```json5
args: ["openclaw-install-policy", "--sandbox", "off"]
```

This alternative runs scanner commands directly inside the Gateway container.
Use it only when that outer environment is intentionally isolated and
disposable. Do not disable the sandbox merely to work around a missing Docker
daemon or mismatched staging paths.

For npm plugin installs, OpenClaw calls the policy before mutation with an
`npm-package-metadata.json` file, then calls it again for the resolved package
and installed dependency tree. ClawScan identifies the metadata stage from its
plugin/npm file-stage shape, then validates the complete host tuple before
allowing the lightweight path: npm origin, immutable network npm source,
package content role, matching package names, and the exact metadata filename.
A malformed metadata-stage tuple fails closed instead of falling through to an
ordinary file scan. Valid metadata uses the built-in static scanner without
Docker and is not presented as a scan of plugin code. The later package and
dependency-tree calls keep the full profile. Dependency packages are exposed
in a dedicated scan view so normal `node_modules` exclusions cannot hide their
code. Local `plugin-file` requests never match the metadata shortcut. A
dependency-tree phase with no installed runtime dependencies returns an
explicit allow/info response because the package itself was already scanned in
the package phase.
For managed npm roots, the dependency view omits only OpenClaw's exact
host-validated `node_modules/openclaw` peer symlink; other links escaping the
staged root fail closed. Safe links within the staged root are dereferenced
into stable copies so scanners inspect the code the installed package will use.

On native Windows, the default profile visibly degrades to
`clawscan-static` with the sandbox disabled because the Linux Docker runtime
cannot consume native Windows staging paths. The response is `warn`, requiring
OpenClaw to obtain explicit confirmation, and includes a finding for this
reduced coverage. Explicit `--scanner` or
`--sandbox` arguments remain operator-owned and disable this automatic fallback.

To use an operator-owned profile, add explicit arguments:

```json5
args: [
  "openclaw-install-policy",
  "--config",
  "/absolute/path/to/.clawscan.yml",
  "--profile",
  "install-policy",
]
```

The configured command is the composition point for multiple checks. ClawScan
does not claim an active-scanner singleton and does not replace other policy
engines. Operators can select several scanner adapters in one profile or wrap
several policy checks behind their configured executable and combine their
responses deterministically. Install-policy profiles must express decisions
through scanner gate rules; judge-backed profiles fail closed because ClawScan
does not define a canonical judge-verdict-to-policy mapping.

## Request and response contract

The command accepts OpenClaw's complete policy payload, including:

- `targetType`: `skill` or `plugin`
- staged `sourcePath` and `sourcePathKind`
- `source` and `origin` metadata
- request kind, install/update mode, and requested specifier
- target-specific skill or plugin metadata

ClawScan uses the host-declared target type, so staged plugin files and
dependency trees are scanned as plugins even when they do not contain a
top-level plugin manifest.

Successful scans return:

```json
{"protocolVersion":1,"decision":"allow"}
```

Warning gate rules return `decision: "warn"` with a required reason and
optional bounded findings. OpenClaw owns the confirmation prompt and resumes
the install only after explicit user confirmation. Blocking gate rules return
`decision: "block"` with a required reason and optional critical findings;
blocks are not overridable. Invalid requests, scanner errors, skipped required
scanners, empty results, and unknown gate verdicts return a valid block response
with a fail-closed reason. OpenClaw also fails closed if the executable cannot
start, times out, exits nonzero, emits malformed output, or does not support a
returned protocol decision.

The policy process never prompts. It does not issue approval tokens, negotiate
capabilities, or maintain install phase IDs. Its only approval signal is the
top-level protocol-v1 decision; OpenClaw owns all acknowledgement state and UI.

## Scope

OpenClaw routes supported third-party skill install/update paths and supported
plugin install/update sources through `security.installPolicy`. Skill Workshop
authoring and manual filesystem copies are outside this supply-chain install
scope.
